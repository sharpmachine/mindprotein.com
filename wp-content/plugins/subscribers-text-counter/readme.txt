== Description ==

This plugin let you create your customized twitter followers, Facebook fans, FeedBurner RSS, YouTube Subscribers,
WordPress members counters. It creates widget or let you display these counters as raw text anywhere in your template
or post/page content. You get it as a text so you may customize design with your own HTML/CSS. All design and icons

With this plugin you will not need any more third party buttons or scripts as it connects directly to FeedBurner,
Facebook, twitter and YouTube APIs. This plugin should speed up your blog as counters are cached in your database

external websites that slow down you blog.
